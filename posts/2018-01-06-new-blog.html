        <p>It’s 2018, I think it’s time for me to start writing blog posts. A lot of people told me writing will improve my thinking, my understanding on the topic i write. Also, by writing, I hope I can share things I am passionate about to larger audience.</p>
<p>I will mainly write posts about these topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong typed language: after learning a bit of Haskell and Idris, I am very interested in how these languages can help us write better software.</li>
<li>Unix-like system and cli tools: I spend most of my time in tmux and vim, I believe terminal apps can help you boost your productivity a lot compared to GUI app. Also I would like to understand more about Unix-like system. I am using Arch linux but also keep an eye on NixOS.</li>
<li>Devops tools: vm, container, scheduler … One day I will control one thousand servers by myself.</li>
<li>Others: can be random topics that catches my attention, such as c, compiler, build x from scratch or how special Nier: Automata is and you should play it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it for the first post to test out my setup, see you next week.</p>
<p><em>P/S: Did you know you can read this blog without JavaScript? And yes, it’s responsive.</em></p>
