        <p>Wellcome back, it’s been a week since my first post. This week i want to write about new vim 8 pacakge management. Before vim 8, to manage plugins, normally you need to install a third-party plugin management such as Pathogen, vim-plug… but starting from vim 8, you can use built-in vim package management to do that.</p>
<p>First, let’s upgrade vim to version 8. You can install it using your OS package management (pacman, brew, …), just make sure it is version 8.</p>
<p><em>I should probably introduce more about vim, but there are some plugin i can’t live without so I need to setup package management first. I promise i will introduce how to use vim later.</em></p>
<p>Here is how vim 8 package management works:</p>
<pre><code>.vim
└── pack
    └── anhduy
        ├── opt
        └── start</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>anhduy</code>: You can name this directory whatever you want, vim doesn’t care about this folder name</li>
<li><code>start</code>: Always loaded plugins directory: put the plugin you want vim to load here</li>
<li><code>opt</code>: Optional plugins directory: vim will not load plugins inside this folder unless you ask it to by running <code>:packadd</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if you want to install <a href="https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a>, just clone it into <code>start</code> and vim will autoload it.</p>
<p>Try another one, clone <a href="https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar">Tagbar</a> into <code>opt</code>, then confirm that you can’t run <code>:Tagbar</code> until you run <code>:packadd tagbar</code></p>
<p>That’s all of it, now you can use plugins with vim itself without any other tools.</p>
<p>Questions from (imagination) readers:</p>
<pre><code>Q: What do you mean by &quot;clone it into start&quot;?
A: That's a [git]() specific term, basically it mean you copy the whole folder and put it inside `start`</code></pre>
<pre><code>Q: Can vim package management allow me to define plugins in vimrc or have command to download plugins
A: No, it only know how to load your plugins</code></pre>
<pre><code>Q: So now my vimrc isn't the source of truth, which defined all my vim config anymore?
A: ...</code></pre>
<pre><code>Q: If i use this, how can i copy by vimrc to a server and use it, before that i have vim-plug download everything for me
A: ... ...</code></pre>
<pre><code>An early converted reader: I removed vim-plug and use vim 8 pacakge management now, it works fine, but how can i update my plugins?
A: ... ... ...</code></pre>
<pre><code>Another early converted: This thing is useless, it can't update my plugins likes vim-plug. How can i update my plugin :rage: ?
A: :dont-know: :who-care:</code></pre>
<pre><code>Others: Wait, wait, I don't understand, what should i do now, please answer above questions :crying:
A: :dun-care: :dun-care: :running-away:</code></pre>
<p>Thanks for reading, see you again next time on how to setup and use vim as main editor.</p>
